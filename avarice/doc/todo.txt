Please feel free to lend a helping hand:

If you do like to dabble:

- Porting to other platforms.

- Add support for watches (ie data space breakpoints).

- Need to add io register definitions for the following devices (this is
  pretty easy, mindless work, just tedious):
    mega162
    mega169
    mega323
    mega32
    mega64
    mega128

- Write a user's manual or some sort of documentation.

- Many many other things!

If coding or porting isn't your thing, you can still help in a big way....

Protocol:
    Atmel have chosen not to publish an official document on the
    protocol. Any mark-ups to doc/avrIceProtocol.txt would be invaluable!
    [Atmel has now published the protocol in appnote AVR060. It's a rather
    confusing document.]

Good old fashioned hands-on testing:

- We can't possibly have tried everything on every system. See if you can
  break it!
