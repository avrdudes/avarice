Please feel free to lend a helping hand:


If you do like to dabble:

- The JTAG target really needs to be properly encapsulated into an
  abstract "target" base class and a "jtag" concrete class. This would
  allow for other targets to be put in place such as Ted Roth's
  excellent simulator idea. (Planning this for the next release). This
  will be in version 2. The work has begun but is a background task to
  getting AVaRICE to be fully functional and stable.

- Porting to other platforms.

- Add a --quit option. Then modify the --program and --erase options to
  NOT quit immediately aftwards (as it currently does). This would allow
  users to combine --quit with either of these so that AVaRICE would
  function as a simple device programmer. Alternatively, the user could
  simply choose the --erase option by itself without the --file. It is
  assumed that GDB would then download the image with 'W' or 'X' GDB
  debug protocol commands (which are sent when the GDB "load" command is
  entered).

- Add support for watches (ie data space breakpoints).

- Fix program space read (ie GDB 'm' command) handling to work correctly
  with odd length reads.

- Add support for setting chip configuration fuses.
  [This very useful feature was John Wood's idea and he is working on
  this one. Contact John (via the mailing list) if you would like to
  lend a hand.]

- Add command line option for setting the JTAG Clock speed. This speed could
  speed thing up a bit.

- Many many other things!

If coding or porting isn't your thing, you can still help in a big way....

Protocol:
    Atmel have chosen not to publish an official document on the
    protocol. Any mark-ups to doc/avrIceProtocol.txt would be invaluable!

Auto Testing:
    One of the major advantages of Aegis (ie test suite support) is
    currently not used. This is truely unacceptable. I would like to add
    tests which actually fire up AVaRICE and avr-gdb and maybe even
    compile a test program and single-step / breakpoints... everything.
    This would be very cool (Aegis users would say that this is
    essential. They would be right).

Good old fashioned hands-on testing:

- I can't possibly have tried everything. See if you can break it!
