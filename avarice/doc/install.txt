So far, avarice has only been tested on an Intel system running Redhat
7.1 Linux. Patches to get it running on other platforms or even a
configure script would be most welcome.


BUILDING WITH MAKE.

Basically, just run make in the prog/avarice directory. This will
compile the avarice program. Just copy the binary to a directory in
your search path.


BUILDING WITH AEGIS & COOK.

Simply create a new project (avarice) and run "aedist -rec" on the
supplied .ae file.

The recipies supplied support parallel cooking.

This project needs four of Peter Millers software packages:

- Aegis
- Cook
- Fhist
- Tardy

All are available at http://www.canb.auug.org.au/~millerp/

The final product is bin/avarice.

Unfortunately, due to inconsistant availability of the JTAG hardware, I
have no host tests for avarice at this time. This will change shortly
(or even sooner if you send a patch!).
