Summary of changes in AVaRICE 2.7
=================================

New CPU support added:
----------------------

. AT90PWM2B/AT90PWM3B (same as AT90PWM2/3 but different signature)
. ATmega325/3250/645/6450

New features added:
-------------------

. Software breakpoints are now also supported when using JTAG.

Summary of important bug fixes:
-------------------------------

. Complete overhaul of the USB communication, making it much more
  robust, and less resource-consuming.

. DebugWire bug fix submittted by Shaun Jackman.


=====================================================================
Summary of changes in AVaRICE 2.6
=================================

New CPU support added:
----------------------

. ATmega164P/324P (removed non-existing ATmega164/324)

New features added:
-------------------

. Support of the AVR Dragon (both, JTAG and debugWire)

Summary of important bug fixes:
-------------------------------

. Don't fork the USB daemon with the libusb handle open;
  instead, re-open the connection in the child.  Fixes issues
  with MacOS X and Cygwin.

=====================================================================
Summary of changes in AVaRICE 2.5
=================================

New CPU support added:
----------------------

. AT90USB1287
. ATmega2560/2561
. debugWIRE AVRs (ATmega48/88/168, ATtiny13, ATtiny2313, AT90PWM2/3,
  ATtiny24/44, ATtiny25/45, ATtiny261/461/861)

New features added:
-------------------

. JTAG daisy chainging
. basic debugWIRE support (still limited to four breakpoints; known
  to occasionally cause trouble over USB, works better over RS-232)

Summary of important bug fixes:
-------------------------------

. fix ucAllowFullPageBitstream for ATmega640/1280/1281, AT90CAN128
. fix device descriptors, in particular EEPROM access on recent AVRs
