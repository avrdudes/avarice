Summary of changes in AVaRICE 2.8
=================================

New CPU support added:
----------------------

. ATtiny84 and ATtiny85 (debugWIRE devices)
. ATmega32C1, ATmega32M1
. AT90PWM316, AT90USB162, AT90USB646, AT90USB647, ATmega1284P,
  ATmega165, ATmega165P, ATmega168P, ATmega16HVA, ATmega3250P,
  ATmega325P, ATmega328P, ATmega3290P, ATmega329P, ATmega32HVB,

  ATtiny43U, ATtiny48, ATtiny88, ATXmega128A1

New features added:
-------------------

. External reset through nSRST (option -R/--reset-srst)

. Handle ICE events (intelligently) beyond just BREAK events

. Option -k/--known-devices to print all known devices

. Default bitrate decreased to 250 kHz to comply with most AVRs
  shipping with a CPU frequency of 1 MHz


Summary of important bug fixes:
-------------------------------

. Fix a bug with single-stepping on the JTAG ICE mkII or AVR Dragon.
  The bug could eventually result in a "Cannot read program counter"
  message.

. Fix a sign-extension bug in the length calculation of received JTAG
  ICE mkII packets that could result in a C++ allocation error.

. [ 1869060 ] jtag daisy chain bits limitations

. [ 1833342 ] useless warning message about jtag bitrate using dragon

. [ 1831392 ] --jtag option does not default to usb using dragon

. [ patch 1750202 ] set parameter command failed

. [ 1865183 ] bfd.h not used for checking of libbfd

. [ 1880464 ] AVR-Dragon needs libusb-dev

. [ 1833340 ] cannot read program counter/Watchdog has expired


=====================================================================
Summary of changes in AVaRICE 2.7
=================================

New CPU support added:
----------------------

. AT90PWM2B/AT90PWM3B (same as AT90PWM2/3 but different signature)
. ATmega325/3250/645/6450

New features added:
-------------------

. Software breakpoints are now also supported when using JTAG.

Summary of important bug fixes:
-------------------------------

. Complete overhaul of the USB communication, making it much more
  robust, and less resource-consuming.

. DebugWire bug fix submittted by Shaun Jackman.


=====================================================================
Summary of changes in AVaRICE 2.6
=================================

New CPU support added:
----------------------

. ATmega164P/324P (removed non-existing ATmega164/324)

New features added:
-------------------

. Support of the AVR Dragon (both, JTAG and debugWire)

Summary of important bug fixes:
-------------------------------

. Don't fork the USB daemon with the libusb handle open;
  instead, re-open the connection in the child.  Fixes issues
  with MacOS X and Cygwin.

=====================================================================
Summary of changes in AVaRICE 2.5
=================================

New CPU support added:
----------------------

. AT90USB1287
. ATmega2560/2561
. debugWIRE AVRs (ATmega48/88/168, ATtiny13, ATtiny2313, AT90PWM2/3,
  ATtiny24/44, ATtiny25/45, ATtiny261/461/861)

New features added:
-------------------

. JTAG daisy chainging
. basic debugWIRE support (still limited to four breakpoints; known
  to occasionally cause trouble over USB, works better over RS-232)

Summary of important bug fixes:
-------------------------------

. fix ucAllowFullPageBitstream for ATmega640/1280/1281, AT90CAN128
. fix device descriptors, in particular EEPROM access on recent AVRs
