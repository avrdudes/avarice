To build avarice from the CVS distribution, you need

  automake 1.7.3
  autoconf 2.57

If you don't have these exact versions, you can get them at ftp://ftp.gnu.org/.
You can try different versions, but automake and autoconf do not handle version
skew very well. The best approach is to grab the required versions and install
them in your home directory. For example this is what I do on my systems:

  mkdir -p $HOME/local/src && cd $HOME/local/src
  wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/autoconf/autoconf-2.57.tar.bz2
  wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/automake/automake-1.7.3.tar.bz2
  bunzip -c autoconf-2.57.tar.bz2 | tar -xf -
  cd autoconf-2.57
  ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local --program-suffix="-2.57"
  make install
  cd ..
  bunzip automake-1.7.3.tar.bz2 | tar -xf -
  cd automake-1.7.3
  ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local --program-suffix="-1.7"
  make install

Now all you need to do is add $HOME/local/bin to the your PATH environment
variable and make sure that the Bootstrap script uses the correct programs. I 
use a wrapper around Bootstrap called bootstrap as such:

  #!/bin/sh
  set -x
  : ${AC_VER="2.57"}
  : ${AM_VER="1.7"}
  AUTOHEADER="autoheader-${AC_VER}"
  AUTOCONF="autoconf-${AC_VER}"
  ACLOCAL="aclocal-${AM_VER}"
  AUTOMAKE="automake-${AM_VER}"
  export AUTOHEADER AUTOCONF AUTOMAKE ACLOCAL
  ./Bootstrap

Directions: in this directory

  ./Bootstrap (once only after checkout)
  ./configure
  make

To install:

  make install

To make a distribution that doesn't need the above tools:

  make dist

or:

  make distdir=<your favourite name for the toplevel directory> dist
