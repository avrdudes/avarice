To build avarice from the CVS distribution, you need

  automake >= 1.7
  autoconf >= 2.57

If needed, a wrapper around Bootstrap can be used to force
using a particular version of these tools (when multiple
versions are installed), like:

  #!/bin/sh
  set -x
  : ${AC_VER="2.57"}
  : ${AM_VER="1.7"}
  AUTOHEADER="autoheader-${AC_VER}"
  AUTOCONF="autoconf-${AC_VER}"
  ACLOCAL="aclocal-${AM_VER}"
  AUTOMAKE="automake-${AM_VER}"
  export AUTOHEADER AUTOCONF AUTOMAKE ACLOCAL
  ./Bootstrap

Directions: in this directory

  ./Bootstrap (once only after checkout)
  ./configure
  make

To install:

  make install

To make a distribution that doesn't need the above tools:

  make dist

or:

  make distdir=<your favourite name for the toplevel directory> dist
